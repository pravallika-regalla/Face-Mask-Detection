# Face-Mask-Detecction
This project will detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not in live video stream.
Using CNN we build a model (latest.h5) which predicts the images whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
Combining both the Human Face Detection program using OpenCv and Trained CNN model we get the final product which detects mask in video stream.
We can also detect masks in images, video and live video stream by using this project.
